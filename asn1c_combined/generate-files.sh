# - Use -fno-included-deps to avoid issue with circular references.
# - Use -fcase-insensitive-filenames for compiling the 2024 specification to work in case-insensitive filesystems such as
# Windows WSL.
# - Use -fwide-types to prevent generating C "long" types for better cross-platform support (Windows "longs" are 32 bits)
# and generally better support for large integer types.
# - Enable JER support by not including '-no-gen-JER'.
